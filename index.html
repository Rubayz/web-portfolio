            <h3>World Class web development student</h3>
            <p>I am a Hablu, Bolod student. You can say, I was a. I have been singing, playing, walking or running all the time. But I could not find a profession in which I can go to. Then, one day, there was a programming contest in our school. Eventually, that was about <b>Arduino</b>. After that contest I didn't win, but I got an idea about programming. So, then I walked doors to doors, flats to flats who can give me an idea about programming. Then I got a friend who told me that at first learn Python and gave me video of 6 hours. Actually, I saw it for only 2 hours. Then, I read articles in internet and  I saw becoming web developer is so easy and so fun. The programming languages are so easy and fun to learn. Then, I learned Basics of HTML and CSS. Thanks.</p>
